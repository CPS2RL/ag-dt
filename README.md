In the code, we have implemented 9 different machine learning models. The models are CNN-based (TCN, ResNet), RNN-based (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU), Transformer-based (TST, Informer) and Hybrid (TST-AE, LSTM-AE).
All of are use for time-series inconsistency classification and fruit surface temperature prediction with and without faults.
